### Project Overview

Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects.
The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics)
is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire,
reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability,
and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly
used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being
acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. These
experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics  --  what are the
underlying constituents of matter and how do they interact. With the discovery
of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics is complete.
It provides an excellent description of known particles and forces.  However,
the most interesting questions remain open: What is the dark matter which
pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend
beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the mechanism
stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum corrections?
The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale
data samples to provide answers. Analyzing this data will require new
and better tools. To improve the quality of the next generation of
software engineers in HEP, DIANA will host an annual workshop on
analysis tools and establish a fellowship program.

First, we will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce
the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas. We will develop software to
effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core hardware. We will establish
infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building
on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling
a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the
experimental community. DIANA’s products will sit in the ROOT framework,
already used by our community of more than 10000 particle and nuclear
physicists. By improving interoperability with the larger scientific software
ecosystem, DIANA will incorporate best practices and algorithms from other
disciplines into HEP. Similarly, we will make our computing insights, tools,
and novel ideas related to collaborative analysis, standards for data
preservation, and best practices for treating software as a research
product available to the larger scientific community.
