### Openings

Coming soon: positions with Cincinnati, Nebraska, NYU and Princeton...

### Cincinnati

The Department of Physics at the University of Cincinnati is currently seeking qualified applicants for the position of 
Sr. Research Associate or Research Scientist (title to be finalized following review of applicants' backgrounds, 
experience and qualifications). Candidates should have significant software development experience, and preferably 
expertise in flavor physics. The job responsibilities fall into two categories: (i) helping develop state-of-the-art 
software tools for high energy physics (and other data-intensive) experiments as part of the the NSF-funded DIANA/HEP 
project and (ii) working as a member of the LHCb collaboration at CERN. The work on LHCb will have 
two components: service work as part of the core computing group and data analysis. The details of all assignments will 
be determined by negotiation between the individual hired and the grant Principal Investigator (Dr. Michael Sokoloff).

All applications received by August 14, 2015 will receive full consideration.

*PLEASE NOTE*: This position is based in Geneva, Switzerland to facilitate working at CERN.

Interested and qualified applicants must complete an online application and submit a curriculm vitae/resume by visiting [this link](http://tinyurl.com/q8bmrt6) (or go to [http://www.uc.edu/hr/toolkits/opportunities.html](http://www.uc.edu/hr/toolkits/opportunities.html) and search for Requisition #5586). For additional information, please send e-mail to [mike.sokoloff@uc.edu](mailto:mike.sokoloff@uc.edu). Applications will be reviewed and considered as they are received.

The University of Cincinnati is an Affirmative Action / Equal Opportunity Employer / M / F / Vet / Disabled.


### Nebraska

Coming soon.

### NYU

An opening for a full-time Postdoctoral Researcher has arisen in association to the DIANA/HEP project. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. 

This position would report to Prof. Kyle Cranmer with the [experimental particle physics group at New York University](http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/) and may receive the honorary title of “Research Engineer” through the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU](http://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/). The focus of this position is on improving interoperability with the scientific python ecosystem and development of collaborative tools. The successful candidate will also be able to devote a significant fraction of their time to their own research program within the ATLAS experiment. We seek applicants both from a traditional HEP background with a strong software focus as well as applicants from the machine learning and data science communities that are interested in HEP research topics.
   
The position can  be based either at NYU or at CERN.  The postdoc can benefit from the lively atmosphere of the [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics (CCPP)](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/) as well as the 
[Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU](http://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/) . Further information on the experimental particle physics group at NYU may be found at [http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/](http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/)

Applications must be submitted via the CCPP Online Application System (please select “DIANA” in your research interests). Complete applications must include a CV, publication list, statement of research interests, and a list of three people who will be submitting letters of recommendation. The position is available immediately and applications will be considered until the position is filled.
