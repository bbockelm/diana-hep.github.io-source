<!--The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics)
is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire,
reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability,
and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly
used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being
acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities.

Advanced software plays a fundamental role in large 
scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop 
state-of-the-art tools for
experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data.
Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools
through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the
community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being
acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities.
As part of the NSF's [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817) program, DIANA is concerned with the overarching goal of transforming innovations in research and education into sustained software resources that are an integral part of the cyberinfrastructure.

### Focus Areas

   *  increase the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce
the iteration time so crucial to exploring new ideas, 

   *  develop
software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core
hardware,

   * establish infrastructure for a higher-level of
collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used
for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication
between the theoretical community and the experimental community,

   * streamline efforts associated to reproducibility, analysis preservation, and data preservation by making these native concepts in the tools, 

   * promote the concept of software as a research product,

   *  improve the interoperability of HEP tools with the larger scientific software
ecosystem, incorporating best practices and algorithms from other disciplines into HEP, and

   *  provide training for students in these techniques.

We will make our tools, computing insights, and approaches to collaborative analysis available to the larger scientific
community.



<!--
   * RIO - ROOT I/O technology

   * Emerging Architectures - vectorization, parallelization, GPUs (GooFit)

   * Interoperability - particularly with the scientific Python ecosystem

   * Collaborative Analysis Tools - RooFit, RooStats, HepData interfaces, and analysis preservation

DIANA/HEP is funded by the National Science Foundation's [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817) program.
