<!-- using bootstrap3 grid layout here -->

The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics)
is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire,
reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability,
and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly
used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being
acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities.

### Focus Areas

   * RIO - ROOT I/O technology

   * Emerging Architectures - vectorization, parallelization, GPUs (GooFit)

   * Interoperability - particularly with the scientific Python ecosystem

   * Collaborative Analysis Tools - RooFit, RooStats, HepData interfaces, and analysis preservation

DIANA/HEP is funded by the National Science Foundation's [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817) program.
